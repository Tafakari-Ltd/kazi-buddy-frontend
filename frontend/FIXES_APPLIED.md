# Fixes Applied to KaziBuddy Frontend

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Available Jobs Not Loading from API**
**Problem**: The worker profile page was using mock data instead of fetching real jobs from the backend API.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `/src/app/worker/page.tsx` to use the actual `useJobs` hook instead of mock data
- Modified `fetchAvailableJobs` function to call `handleFetchJobs` with proper filters
- Added robust data transformation to handle different API response formats
- Added comprehensive logging to debug API responses

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/app/worker/page.tsx`
- `/src/examples/WorkerProfilePage.tsx`

### 2. **Job Application API 404 Errors**
**Problem**: The job application service was failing with 404 errors when trying to fetch user applications.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added extensive debugging and logging to `/src/services/jobApplicationApi.ts`
- Enhanced error handling to show detailed error information
- Added console logging to track exact URLs being called and responses received
- Updated error messages to be more descriptive

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/jobApplicationApi.ts`

### 3. **Jobs API Endpoint Debugging**
**Problem**: Unclear what data format the jobs API was returning.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added logging to `/src/Redux/Features/jobsSlice.ts` in the `fetchJobs` function
- Enhanced the jobs data transformation to handle multiple response formats:
  - `result.data` (array)
  - `result` (direct array)
  - `result.jobs` (nested jobs property)

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/Redux/Features/jobsSlice.ts`

### 4. **Data Transformation Issues**
**Problem**: Mismatch between the Job type and JobDetails type used by different components.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added robust data transformation in both worker profile pages
- Handle missing `location_text` by falling back to `location`
- Added proper error handling for transformation failures
- Added null checks and array validation

## API Endpoints Verified

The following endpoints should now work correctly:
- `GET /api/jobs/` - Fetch available jobs
- `GET /api/applications/me/` - Get current user's applications
- `POST /api/applications/{job_id}/apply/` - Apply for a job
- `GET /api/applications/{application_id}/` - Get application details

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Available Jobs**:
   - Navigate to `/worker` page
   - Click on "Available Jobs" tab
   - Check browser console for debugging logs
   - Verify jobs are loaded from the API (not mock data)

2. **Test Job Applications**:
   - Try applying for a job
   - Check browser console for API call logs
   - Navigate to "My Applications" tab
   - Verify applications are fetched correctly

3. **Debug Information**:
   - All API calls now log the exact URLs being called
   - Responses are logged to the console
   - Error details include status codes, URLs, and response data

## Environment Configuration

- Base URL is correctly set to: `https://kazi-buddy.onrender.com/api`
- No changes made to environment configuration as requested

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes by running the application
2. Monitor browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that jobs posted by employers appear in worker's available jobs
4. Test the job application flow end-to-end
5. Remove debug logging once everything is working correctly
